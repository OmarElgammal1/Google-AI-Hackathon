<h1>Machine Learning Concepts</h1>

<p Each training example is called a <strong>training instance</strong> (or <strong>sample</strong>).</p>

<p>The part of a machine learning system that learns and makes predictions is called a <strong>model</strong>.</p>

<p>Neural networks and random forests are examples of <strong>models</strong>.</p>

<p In this case, the task <em>T</em> is to flag spam for new emails, the experience <em>E</em> is the <strong>training data</strong>, and the performance measure <em>P</em> needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of correctly classified emails.</p>

<p>This particular performance measure is called <strong>accuracy</strong>, and it is often used in <strong>classification</strong> tasks.</p>
