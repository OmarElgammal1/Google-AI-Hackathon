  <h1>Machine Learning Concepts</h1>

  <p><mark>Each training example is called a training instance (or sample).</mark></p>

  <p>The part of a machine learning system that learns and makes predictions is called a model.</p>

  <p><mark>In this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training data, and the performance measure P needs to be defined.</mark></p>

  <p>This particular performance measure is called accuracy, and it is often used in classification tasks.</p>
