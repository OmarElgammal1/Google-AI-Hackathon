  <h1>What Is Machine Learning?</h1>

  <p>Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so
  they can learn fr om data.</p>

  <p>Here is a slightly more general definition:</p>

  <p class="bold italic">[Machine learning is the] field of study that gives computers the
  ability to learn without being explicitly pr ogrammed.</p>

  <p>-Arthur Samuel, 1959</p>

  <p>And a more engineering-oriented one:</p>

  <p class="bold italic">A computer pr ogram is said to learn fr om experience E with r espect
  to some task T and some performance measur e P, if its performance
  on T, as measur ed by P, impr oves with experience E.</p>

  <p>-Tom Mitchell, 1997</p>

  <p>Your spam filter is a machine learning program that, given examples of
  spam emails (flagged by users) and examples of regular emails (nonspam,
  also called “ham”), can learn to flag spam. The examples that the system
  uses to learn are called the training set.</p>

  <p class="highlight">- Machine learning involves programming computers to learn from data, allowing them to adapt without explicit programming.</p>
  <p class="highlight">- Machine learning encompasses various subfields, including supervised and unsupervised learning, online and batch learning, and instance-based and model-based learning.</p>
  <p class="highlight">- The workflow of a machine learning project typically involves data collection, model selection, training, evaluation, and fine-tuning.</p>
