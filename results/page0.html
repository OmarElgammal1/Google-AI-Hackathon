  <h1>Chapter 1. The Machine Learning Landscape</h1>

  <p>Not so long ago, if you had picked up your phone and asked it the way home, it would have ignored you—and people would have questioned your sanity.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">But <span style="background-color: yellow;">machine learning is no longer science fiction: billions of people use it every day.</span></p>

  <p>And the truth is it has actually been around for decades in some specialized applications, such as optical character recognition (OCR).</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: the spam filter.</span></p>

  <p>It’s not exactly a self-aware robot, but it does technically qualify as machine learning: it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore.</p>

  <p>It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds of products and features that you use regularly: voice prompts, automatic translation, image search, product recommendations, and many more.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Where does machine learning start and where does it end?</span></p>
