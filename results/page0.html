        <h1>Chapter 1. The Machine Learning Landscape</h1>
        <p>Not so long ago, if you had picked up your phone and asked it the way home, it would have ignored you—and people would have questioned your sanity.</p>
        <p>But <strong><span class="highlight">machine learning</strong> is no longer science fiction: billions of people use it every day.</span></p>
        <p>The first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: the <em>spam filter</em>.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">It’s not exactly a self-aware robot, but it does technically qualify as machine learning: it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore.</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds of products and features that you use regularly: voice prompts, automatic translation, image search, product recommendations, and many more.</span></p>
        <p>Where does machine learning start and where does it end?</p>
