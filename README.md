A creative app built with Google's Generative AI tools with Gemini.
## Inspiration
As we are students, we often have to read a lot of PDFs. We often find ourselves highlighting important text in the PDFs. but the problem is that resources are a lot and we can't highlight all the text. So we thought of creating a tool that can highlight the text in the PDFs for us.
## What it does
we have created a tool that can highlight the important text in the PDFs. It can highlight the text in the PDFs.
## How we built it
we have used langchain in collaboration with gemni api to create this tool. We have used the langchain to extract the text from the PDFs, splitting it into chuncks, creating a vector database of the text, and then using the gemni api to summarize the text in the PDFs. and pass the summarized text to the langchain to highlight the text in the PDFs.
## Challenges we ran into
we have faced a lot of challenges in this project. The main challenge was to extract the text from the PDFs and then highlight the text in the PDFs. We have used langchain to extract the text from the PDFs and then used the gemni api to summarize the text in the PDFs. and then pass the summarized text to the langchain to highlight the text in the PDFs.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
highlighting the text in the PDFs.
## What we learned
how to use langchain and how powerful it is in addition to the gemni api and its super capabilities in summarizing the text.
## What's next for Text Highlight PDF
sync the highlighted text with the google drive, notion and evernote making it available for the users to access it from anywhere.
